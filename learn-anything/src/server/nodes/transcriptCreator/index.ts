The transcript should be divided into a maximum of 6 scenes, with each scene clearly marked by '## SCENE <scene number>'. Focus on delivering clear educational messages, while maintaining natural transitions between scenes to keep the audience engaged.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Understand Content**: Thoroughly review the provided content to extract key educational points and messages.\n2. **Plan Scenes**: Break down the content into a maximum of 6 scenes, each focusing on specific key points or topics.\n3. **Write Transitions**: Craft natural transitions for the start and end of each scene to ensure a smooth flow of information.\n4. **Scene Crafting**: Write each scene to clearly and effectively convey the educational content.\n\n# Output Format\n\n- Start with '## SCENE 1', then write the transcript for the scene.\n- For each subsequent scene, start with '## SCENE <scene number>'.\n- Ensure each scene includes clear and natural transition elements at the beginning and end.\n\n# Example\n\n**Example Input:**\n\n```text\nContent about 'The Water Cycle Explained': Discuss the processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection in the water cycle, and explain how they contribute to Earth's ecosystem.\n```\n\n**Example Transcript Output:**\n\n- ## SCENE 1\n  \"Have you ever wondered how water travels around our planet? Let's explore the stages of the water cycle, starting with evaporation.\"\n\n- ## SCENE 2\n  \"Evaporation happens when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, or oceans, turning it into vapor that rises into the air.\"\n\n- ## SCENE 3\n  \"As this water vapor rises, it cools and undergoes condensation, forming clouds made up of tiny water droplets.\"\n\n- ## SCENE 4\n  \"When these droplets combine and grow heavy, they fall as precipitation—rain, snow, sleet, or hail—back to the Earth's surface.\"\n\n- ## SCENE 5\n  \"This water then collects in bodies of water or seeps into the ground, a process known as collection, and the cycle starts again.\"\n\n- ## SCENE 6\n  \"Understanding the water cycle shows us how vital water is to our ecosystem, constantly recycling to sustain life on Earth.\"\n\n# Notes\n\n- Ensure each scene transition smoothly connects to the next educational point.\n- Maintain a clear and informative tone suitable for an educational TikTok audience.",
